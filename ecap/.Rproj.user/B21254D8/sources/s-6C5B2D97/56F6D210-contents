\title{ECAP adjust probability estimates}
\usage{
ecap_adj(unadjusted_prob, lambda, gamma, theta = 0)
}
\value{
A list where the first element is a vector of the ECAP adjusted probabilities. The second
is a matrix of the unadjusted and ecap probabilities.
}
\description{
This function ECAP adjust probability estimates. As an input, the function takes a
numeric vector of probabilities, an estimate of 3 parameters needed for the ecap adjustment.
The level of corruption, the bias, and a tuning parameter that adjust the level of flexibility in
the ECAP estimation procedure. As an output, a vector of ECAP probabilities are returned along with
a matrix that includes the ECAP probabilities along with the unadjusted ones.
